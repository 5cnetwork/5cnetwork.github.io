Radiology is a specialized branch of medicine using medical imaging technologies to diagnose and treat patients. The role of the radiologist involvement has increased drastically in the clinical management of patients with the development of medical image technology such as X-Ray, CT scan, MRI, PET scan and etc.

**Some Statistics:**

 A country with a billion population and around 8000 radiologist leads to a huge disproportion effecting millions of lives. Now according to the Indian Journal of Radiology and imaging, “_In the next decade, radiology will have a very limited role to play. USG facilities will double and CT scan and MRI will continue to grow in an exponential way, with more and more indications being included. Molecular imaging will become available in all the big metros. India will need about 20,000 radiologists if the benefits of imaging are to reach every corner of the country._”
 
“_growth rates of CT and MRI in Sweden have continuously exceeded growth rates of practicing radiologists_”, according to a new report from telemedicine firm TMC.

“_France, which performs more CT exams than any other country in Europe, faces a double threat regarding its radiologist population_”
