In the mathematical area of graph theory, a clique (/ˈkliːk/ or /ˈklɪk/) is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that its induced subgraph is complete; that is, every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent.

"5-Clique" is the problem of finding a clique of 5 vertices in a graph (5 vertices, all of whom are adjacent to each other). Finding cliques in a graph is a really hard problem, and has been chronicalled in the annals of Computer Science extensively.

5C (or 5Clique) is India’s first Diagnostics Network, and we bring together all 5 stakeholders in the Diagnostic process: Clinicians, Radiologists, patients, technicians and Health Centres, and aid in better diagnosis, better decision making and better patient outcomes. We've solved the 5-Clique problem in healthcare, and we're using it to revolutionize diagnosis.
