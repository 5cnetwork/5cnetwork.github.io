Dr. L S Sathyamurthy is a towering figure in the field of Telemedicine today. One could say that his efforts during his tenure with ISRO gave wings to what is now a vibrant ecosystem in India, with private players, governments and NGOs all using this concept to bridge the healthcare delivery gap. His work as the President of The Telemedicine Society of India bears testament to his passion and drive to solve India's widespread Healthcare problem through technology. We had an opportunity to sit down with this legend and pick his brain on all things Telehealth.

**Q:  What inspired you to start telemedicine in India and who are the major contributor?**

_A: I was the program director of telemedicine in the year 2001 and I was asked by the chairman of ISRO Dr. kartus to start the telemedicine program since the ISRO has the satellite connectivity. There we tried to bring in technology and the doctors together to give something to the nation by connecting remote rural hospitals to the higher level specialized hospital. That’s how I was introduced to the telemedicine technology._

**Q:  How was the first telemedicine system and what role ISRO played in that?**

_A: Before building the technology, we started learning about it. Connecting two remotes places via satellite connectivity or wired connectivity. But the more important was how can we transfer the data and how can we use video confessing to connect patients with doctors. This system was a medium for patients to get treated or to take opinion from a doctor and simultaneously we can send patients record or data to the doctors’ system. And the whole software system was developed by our own Indian company. Initially, we used point to point connection but later when we move to larger or bigger hospital, we started using point to multi-point. Starting from satellite to wired connection then wireless and today we have a mobile connection._
 
**Q:  What are the difficulties faced by your team when telemedicine just started?**

_A: Initially, when we started with some small government rural hospital and some trusted hospital, the major challenges are the acceptance by the rural government hospital for which we took order issue from the government and Karnataka government health administrator helped us and they influenced those rural hospitals to use this telemedicine. By 2008 we had a vibrant network of 350 remote hospitals connected to 50 specialized hospitals._

**Q:  Does India is lagging behind in the field telemedicine or not?**

_A: No, India is one of the leading countries in the field of telemedicine. In fact in 2002 India had the largest network but ISRO has given its connectivity till 2010 and soon they have to withdraw the connection as they are providing this free connection for long period of time hence some states started having some problem._

**Q:  according to the Indian Journal Psychological medicine, It says that in whole Karnataka there are around 26 district hospital connected to 11 specialized hospitals out of which 10 hospitals do not have power backup, the connection of satellite is acceptable only in 18 hospital, technician are not provided proper training and only in 13 centre doctors keep the appointment. So what’s your view regarding those problems?**

_A:   Currently, all the rural hospitals are provided with 4 hours power backup UPS and many have their own generator. Regarding the satellite connection, this problem came when ISRO removed the satellite connection but now they are using Karnataka Wide area network which is sufficient. 
The technician problem happens when they leave the center in between and the new technician won't get enough training. But currently we don’t have this problem as every technician undergoes training at Vikas Global Solution and then they are sent to the fields. 
Doctors are very busy, we told them to make a schedule and now everything is happening properly._

**Q: In many remote places there is still insufficient electricity and internet service provider are not available. So how telemedicine can reach out all those places?**

_A: If the rural places are too remote then government itself can provide satellite connection otherwise if mobile connection is available then it is sufficient for the transferring of required data using WhatsApp or some social media. Recently ISRO is developing new satellite which can provide a very good connection._

**Q. Today everyone talks about telemedicine but what exactly is telemedicine and video calling with a doctor on Skype is also a telemedicine or not?**

_A. telemedicine is about two things, one is transferring of data i.e., patients history or the required reports through which doctors can give a prescription and second is patient’s satisfaction. Regarding those video calling apps, they cannot be called as telemedicine because there are standard terms and condition which they not follows._

**Q: what message can you give to the youth and young entrepreneur in India?**

_A. Many entrepreneurs think that telemedicine is a software in health but wrong. Companies should take the total service, they should either appoint doctors and they should run companies with doctors so that smooth transition can take place. Whereas if you simply put some machine and install software then the technician will say it’s not good and doctors will say it’s not working. Being an entrepreneur takes the ownership by giving total care solution._
