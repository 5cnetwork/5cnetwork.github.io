Once someone said how difficult it to give birth girl child in a society where sons are considered everything. In the early 1990s, an affordable ultrasound technology spread across India and people start using it for sex determination. According to The Time of India, the BMC data shows that there is a rise in abortion in India, i.e., 13% jump from 2015 to 2016.   

Female foeticide is one of the blasting issues today. Female feticide is a process of aborting female foetuses after about 18 weeks of gestation or we can say that killing or murdering a female child within the womb of a mother. 

**Causes of Female Foeticide**

Today in the 21st century where the world coming with new ideas and thoughts and everyone is given equal freedom and mentality of the people changed but the life of a girl or a woman is marked with big disrespect. 

The whole process of checking of sex begins with the initiation of government itself. Due to the problem of increasing in population because people give birth to so many to get the one boy child. Hence the government introduced those new technologies in public hospital in the 1970s to check the sex of the child. Since then the major population and the doctors got aware of this technology, female foeticide starts growing exponentially.

The reasons why female foeticide happing in India or the rest of the world varies for the different background of people. If we concentrate in India, the biggest issue or the reason is the dowry system. According to Wikipedia, [“Dowry”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry_system_in_India) refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage. 

Nowadays it became when worse that people started asking so much money and bride’s family not able to fulfill it. That is the issue where people with low financial are not willing to have a girl child.  Hence female foeticide is the only solution to those families. 

Next, we have is the education of girl child. People strongly believe that educating a girl or spending some money for schools or colleges is not worth because at last they belong to some other family and the girl family will not get benefit from her knowledge.

The government has taken different steps like women empowerment, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, education of girl child and the most important _Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994_ to stop female foeticides in India. 

**Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act**

This act was passed by the Parliament of India in 1994 to stop female foeticides and hold the declining sex ratio in India due to the female foeticides. Basically Pre-Natal Diagnostic technique are helpful for planning for possible complication with the birth process, deciding whether to continue the pregnancy, finding a condition that may affect  future pregnancy or managing the remaining week of the pregnancy but some narrow-minded people use such medical technique like ultrasonography and Amniocentesis to determine sex which leads to the sex-selective abortion. 

Hence government came up with such act that not only prohibits determination and disclosure of the sex but also bans the content or ads indicating of techniques related to prenatal sex determination. 
 
Sex determination was a sensitive topic in India and it will remain sensitive unless we don’t change our ideology. A society where men are considered superior to women. Is that a fact? No, it’s just our believe and believe is something that happens due to cascading.  So let’s stop cascading this and save children from getting killed or murdered. More than law, it’s about humanity.
