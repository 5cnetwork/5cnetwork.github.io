Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standard is a network protocol that has been used for years to handling, storing, printing and transmit medical images.

It was initially developed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) in 1985 as in the beginning it was very difficult for other than manufacturers of MRI and CAT devices to decode the image generated by the machines.  In 1988 the second version was released and the first large-scale deployment of the technology was made in 1992 by the US Army and Air Force. Soon in 1993 the latest version was released and named as DICOM. 

**Technical background of DICOM**
 The DICOM protocol is compatible with Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This enables DICOM application entities to communicate over the Internet. DICOM standard support five general applications. 
 
* Network Image Management
* Network image interpretation management
* Network print management
* Imaging procedure management
* Off-line storage media management

**Network Image Management:**

   It supports two general services: push and pull. In push mode, one device sends images to another device over a network. Whereas in pull mode, it retrieve the selected images
    
**Network image interpretation management:**

   It provides services such as network image interpretation object and a corresponding interpretation storage service. 
 
**Network print management:**
 
   It enables image acquisition devices and workstations to share a printer on a DICOM network similar to the way that personal computers share a networked laser printer or in simple words The DICOM print service is used to send images to a DICOM printer. 
 
**Imaging procedure management:**
 
   This component provides comprehensive imaging procedure management capability. It maps to requested procedures, and map to performed procedure steps. It also provides state management and event notification facilities.

**Off-line Storage Media Management:**

   DICOM Off-line Storage Media Management enables users to manually exchange DICOM files on removable storage media.

DICOM is used extensively for medical imaging in hospitals. It is used in the processes of diagnosing and treating patients, tracking patient outcomes, Tele-radiology to transmit radiological patient images, such as X-ray, CT, and MRI. The success of DICOM cannot be interrupted as it has shown the path for medical devices to associate with one another since many years back. 

The polishes that being introduced in the mechanism of DICOM is constantly improving in terms of hardware interfacing, image display, etc.

Because of its ease of integration and continuous evolution this communication standard has over the years achieved a nearly universal level of acceptance among vendors of radiological equipment.

The digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standard provide the Structured Report (SR) to the imaging diagnostic report. Despite the numerous advantages DICOM, the most important is structured. The radiologistâ€™s findings and impressions constitute a major part of the imaging report content. 

In the decades since that first committee sat down, DICOM has become the foundation of image exchange, so much so that it is often referred to as DICOM image exchange.
