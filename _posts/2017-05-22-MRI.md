Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses magnetism, radio wave, and a computer to produce images of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. This technology is one of the most sophisticated diagnostic tools available to help a referring clinician understand the cause of your particular health issue. 

 It is used to find problems such as tumors, bleeding, injury, blood vessel diseases, or infection. It can be used to provide further information for the results of X-ray, ultrasound scan or CT scan. This is one of the extremely accurate methods of disease detection throughout the body and over 25000 scanners are estimated to be in use worldwide. 

Unlike other medical technology, MRI has a complicated history.

Today’s advance technology like MRI works on the principle called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomenon which was independently discovered in 1946 by Felix Bloch, a Swiss physicist and Edward Mills Purcell, an American physicist. Soon in 1952, both were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery. People started using NMR to study the molecular structure of a pure material and the composition of the mixture. (Physical and chemical properties) But an American physicist and pioneer of magnetic resonance imaging called Hermann Y. Carr describes the first technique that can produce one-dimensional MR image for his doctorate thesis on 1952, although this was not approved until the 1970s.

In 1971, an American physician Raymond Damadian found that the hydrogen nuclei of water in cancer tissue and healthy tissue showed the difference in relaxation time. Hence cancer and the normal tissue can be differentiated using nuclear magnetic resonance. 

On July 3, 1977, He successfully produces first MRI of a body which was performed on Sir peter and Andrew Maudsley’s finger and it took almost five hours to produce one. But his method was never used because that was not practically implementable today. 

In 1978, he formed a group of team and soon after one year they build and produce their first commercial MRI scanner. Today he maintained almost everything of the company and in 2007 he collaborated with a pacemaker company and as the result, they produce world’s first multi-positional MRI. It was also recognized as the Invention of the year.

After one year of the invention of first commercial MRI scanner, on 28 August they used that machine to produce the first medical image of internal tissue which can to find the abnormalities like a primary tumor in the patient's chest, an abnormal liver, and secondary cancer in his bones. 

By 1990s, the machine can perform MRI of brain and heart and many health care organization started using MRI for neuroimaging and musculoskeletal. 

Today we mainly use MRI of 1.5 Tesla but the system having 3 Tesla are gaining more popularity due to their more sensitivity and resolution and some even moved to 7 Tesla MRI. 

MRI is one of the extremely accurate methods to diagnose but it’s not the preferred one first due to the time and expenses of the procedure. Sometimes it can also produce claustrophobia i.e., irrational fear of confined places.
