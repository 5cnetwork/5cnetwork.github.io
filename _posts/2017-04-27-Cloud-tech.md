**_Everyone in the technology world and business are talking about it_**
 
 **_Everyone is talking about “the cloud.” But what does it mean?_**

The word cloud is utilized as an analogy for the network, In the most straightforward terms, cloud computing implies getting to information and projects over the network rather than your PC's hard drive. 

We're talking about cloud computing as it impacts individual consumers—those who sit back at home or in small to medium offices and use the Internet on a regular basis.

Next, the big businesses; “_The market generating compound annual growth rate from nearly $70B in 2015 to more than $141B in 2019_”, according to Forbes magazine  


**Before cloud boom**

Traditional way of business has always been very complicated and expensive. The amount and assortment of equipment and software required to run them are not very palling. We require an entire group of specialists to introduce, arrange, test, run, secure, and refresh them. 

**Ease that cloud brought**

You are most likely utilizing cloud computing at this moment, regardless of the possibility that you don't understand it. In case you utilize an online support to send email, alter files, watch films or TV, tune into music or store pictures and different records, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all conceivable.

 A cloud technology can powerfully scale to address the issues of its clients, and in light of the fact that the specialist supplies the equipment and software essential for the administration, there's no requirement for an organization to arrangement or convey its own particular assets or assign IT staff to deal with the administration.
 
Cloud itself is a walking house of hardware and software designed to provide easy and scalable access to applications, resources and services, and is fully managed by a cloud services provider. 
  
**Cloud technology**

The underlying concept of cloud computing dates back to 1969. Later Amazon played a key role in developments of cloud computing and the new Amazon infrastructure resulted in significant internal efficiency improvement. It started in 2006 when Amazon began offering its simple storage service and soon following up with its Elastic Compute Service. This is a secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  

It has as of now begun its revolution in the IT segment. Improvement in the quantity of Service provider and the quantity of the start-up relying on cloud based technology has also increased. Cloud had made everything cheaper and better than the on-premise services. The services offered by the cloud is the reason for its tremendous growth. In the previous couple of years, cloud had met all the computational necessities of the client and changed the way of processing.
 
Types of services provided by cloud:
* [infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh509051.aspx)
* [platform as a service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/)
* [software as a service (Saas)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905332.aspx)  

Types of cloud deployment: 
*	**public:** A public cloud basically uses the internet to make resources, such as applications (Software-as-a-service) and storage, accessible to the overall population, or on a public cloud.  Examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, IBM’s Blue Cloud and Windows Azure Services Platform. The public cloud may not be the right fit for every organization. The model can limit configuration, security, and making it less ideal for services to process sensitive data.

*	**private:** A private cloud is particularly modelled for cloud computing in which only specified user can operate. This model provides computing power as a service within an environment using computing resources.  Nonetheless, these resources are only accessible by a single organisation with greater control and privacy. This is usually not an option for the average Small-to-Medium sized business and is most typically put to use by large enterprises. 

*	**hybrid:** A hybrid cloud is an incorporated cloud using both private and public clouds. An enterprise could implement hybrid cloud hosting to host their e-commerce website within a private cloud, where it is secure and scalable, but their brochure site in a public cloud.

The ever increasing demand of processing power cannot be addressed using the traditional server and the data centre technology. Therefore, we now have cloud computing  

**Cloud in healthcare:**

In view of current use of healthcare assets, it is evaluated that the development in primary care doctor supply won't be sufficient to take care of demand in future. The options we have to overcome this are to either increase the number of doctors or technology.

Utilization of cloud technology has taken off crosswise over multitudinous sectors. In the previous couple of years, medical service ventures have understood the capability of cloud computing and how it can help them to give quality service to patients. Demand for healthcare will proceed to rise, mainly because of the populace maturing and growth but also from the will to stay healthy. 

Healthcare cloud services generally use standard protocols, so connecting them to other systems and applications is typically straightforward. Exchanging health data is also an important factor. But the obstacles are cooperating with the medical technologies where medical data from machines are not designed to associate with internet.

Today the healthcare facility is enhanced by the cloud based healthcare sector that offers the potential for interoperability and integration and it also offers better security and privacy for medical data and health systems confirming the standards.

Producing innovative, fast and cooperative cloud environment for healthcare in which all contributors can help to simplify, organise and improve the forming healthcare technology. With this solution, health ventures can stop fettering over small stuff and start centring on improving patients treatment.
