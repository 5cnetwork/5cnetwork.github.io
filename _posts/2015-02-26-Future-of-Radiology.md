**Q: What is your view about the future of radiology in India?**

**A:** _The future of radiology is excellent in India; the main reason is because of this huge population. Radiology is a super speciality or end speciality subject and it is required by orthopedician, gynaecologist, paediatrician, surgeons as we provide the road map for all the clinicians. Radiologists minimize the surgery or intervention as they can perfectly localize which area is exactly required for the intervention or to perform surgery. This way it safes lots of money, time and gives accuracy where time, money and accuracy is the trend in present generation as everyone wants to save all this. Especially in a country like India where there is a huge population and to cater the health service for such population the required time is very less. So the radiologist got a huge role to play to reduce the time. Let’s take an example of Tele-radiology which is a distance reporting technique that reduces the cost of that local hospital to bear a radiologist. Even if they bear the cost, they might not get good radiologists. So, a good radiologist sitting at a distinct place can save the money for him and at the mean time the patient will also get a good report from a good radiologist._

**Q: Clearly technologies are advancing quickly in a short span; CAD computer aided diagnosis: system that process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional. 
Don’t you think such advancement in technology in the field of radiology can take away the future of radiologist where system will diagnose and detect threats, so what you think about this? Don’t you think in future the radiologists have a less role to play in the field of radiology because of enhancement in technology?** 

**A:** _They can help to some extend to diagnosis but the presentation of the diseases in the patient or the human being is changing day-by-day because the bacteria and the viruses are going mutated and change their forms which suits for their environment. E.g.  
Suppose we have machines which diagnose TB of the lung, now what is the role of radiologist if machine itself tells whether the person got TB or not? The role of radiologist is when the presentation of these kinds of diseases changes because TB typically doesn’t appear like before, today it looks like a cancer but when we do a biopsy we get to know it’s a tuberculosis. That required experiences and clinical skills. Therefore I don’t think technology can replace the radiologist but they can surely reduce the burden on them._

**Q: India is a populous country with over a billion people and there is approximately one radiologist for every 100,000 population (compared to US where the corresponding ratio is 1:10,000). But the imaging technology will get double within couple of years with enhancement. So what is our radiologists plan to cope up with the advancement in radiology, does current number of radiologist along with the program like e-kirana will able to handle the whole country in future?**

**A:** _It has the potential to solve the issue of the whole country. In victoria hospital, one radiologist is sitting here and he is addressing 5 different district hospitals. Since Karnataka have 30 districts, so only 6 radiologists can easily handle the whole government district hospitals in Karnataka. Imagine the number radiologist in Karnataka, numerous. Provided human resources or the availability of the radiologist are used in a proper manner. It should be planned, channelized and organised then the current numbers of radiologists are sufficient to serve the whole population. If the program like e-Kirana is provided to entire country and nodal centre should be set-up in major cities where radiologists can physically come, access and work._

**Q: In what way radiologist can contribute towards the future of the radiology in India?**

**A:** _Since I am a radiologist, I was the nodal officer for this e-Kirana where I have contributed my skills and knowledge on how e-Kirana needs to be programmed, what sort of software is required by radiologists to provide a good report, how the flow char is required for the entry of the scans, reporting of scans, the sending of the scans. Our skills are passed to the technologist to develop such software. So we are like reference where we give the required input and make the reporting faster, more accurate and required updates for the software. We are mainly contributing in the field of interventional radiology._

**Q: What are your thoughts about interventional radiology and the role of radiologist solely as diagnosticians in the near future?**

**A:** _Excellent! The role of radiologist in interventional radiology is very important and has played vital and will be playing vital role in future because it again turn down the cost, time and accuracy during the complicated surgery. For diagnosticians radiologist, it is excellent because while performing the interventional procedure, let’s say the pathology inside the body needs to be diagnose, so at that point I am a diagnosticians and at the same time I can also treat it also. E.g. A patient fallen down and I diagnose and I am see bleeding in the brain. Now the diagnosticians’ job is done. But I am doing a neurosurgeon job also where I’m giving a dye and sealing is off so the procedure was both diagnostic and clinician._

**Q: Does India is lagging behind other country in the field of radiology and its technology? If does, what can our future step?**

**A:** _If we compare ourselves with other countries, they have progressed much better than India as software concern and updated machine. We are up with other countries on base line of radiology but in the field of research and further improvising we are lagging. With respect to the variety of cases and the quality of cases, India is number one because of the the large population. So the radiologist trained in India can report to any other country because they have seen the rarest of the rare cases in India.   
The solution to overcome this problem is more funding from the Government or WHO as more number of machines are required with respect to the population of the country._

**Q: If the future of radiology needs to survive then what suggestions you want to give to the youth and the entrepreneur in India?**

**A:** _I would suggest young doctors to do radiology because there is a huge scarcity of radiologist in the world. Since there are only few seats they should be highly inside their work.  So i will definitely recommend young one to do radiology and serve the society for betterment. As entrepreneur concern, there are lots of them who are coming up with Tele-radiology technology. Tele-radiology is not the only thing that entrepreneur needs to concentrate; there are robotic biopsy machine where robot can perform biopsy and they do the interventional, they can also work on machine which can detect diseases on its own. 
E.g. suppose we have device which can detect Tuberculosis of chest of 500 people, if not accurately diagnosed but at least it can segregate the normal from the diseased one. At last the confirmation can be made by the radiologist. Therefore, the entrepreneur got a very major role to play because there are lots of room left to discover and invent._

**Q: What is the problem regarding the current generation radiologists?**

**A:** _Current generation radiologists are good, only thing is they are lagging in
Clinical skills. They are good in reading images and technologies but clinical skills like touching the patient, feeling them and making them comfortable are absent these days. Therefore, younger generation should clinically more involve._

**Q: Quality is everything for radiologist, but in a world where turn around time is considered as king, how do experts like you manage time and quality expectation?**

**A:** _Any doctor for that matter the quality in report and the quality in treatment is the first thing they required. The quality should never be compromise by any doctor or radiologist because we are playing with life. Since the quality is very important it doesn’t matter whether we have time or not, whether a huge population is there or not, we don’t have an option because we don’t have second choice to sacrifice quality. Just because large queue is there I cannot give sub-standard or second class report and play with patient’s life. Suppose 1000 patients are waiting and I can see only 500 till my last breath but I’ll give the quality to the 500, the best whatever I have to the 500 patients and I’ll finished off. For the next 500 either next radiologist or next team of doctors will be treating. Just because I have to treat 1000 of patient we don’t come down with the quality. 
If we come down with the quality then the whole point of health care is gone._

>**message**

>_“ To young doctors, I always tell them to take up radiology as their profession since it is very important subject till date where it is changing life’s of patients at great extend and also for clinicians to diagnose. We are playing major role in others life more than a doctor as a radiologist. Therefore i suggest young generation to opt for radiology, work hard in the field, excel, produce result and finally deliver to the patients. Contributing to our society should be our first priority.”_
