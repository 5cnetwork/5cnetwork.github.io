**The greatest choice is whether to have a cloud based or local server foundation.**

It may be that you're beginning a business and thinking about whether an in-house server is satisfactory or you ought to embrace Cloud technology to begin. Cloud server refers to a server application that is hosted on a third party’s network infrastructure and the local server refers to the scenario where server is hosted on local area network. 

Ensuring that organization information is stacked and secure is vital for any business. Choosing whether to store information on cloud or local server is a huge dilemma for many organisations.

**Local server:**

Truly, this is the conventional technique in setting up the network. 

At the point when your server is local, it gives us a complete physical control over the server. Keeping the critical information at priority, this way it keeps the third party away to access the information and user need not have to rely on internet connection to access the data. More on this, the administrator can upgrade the server to meet the needs of the company as it grows without any monthly hosting fee.

On the drawback, at initial it requires huge capital investment in hardware and data centres. It is comparatively more happing to data loss during disaster situation due to the on-premises than the cloud technology which will there in some third party system. It also required a group of experts to maintain the data centres. The scalability is also an issue, required additional data centre investment on demand. It also needs good backup policy and backup infrastructure. 
  
**Cloud server:**

Just like on site server, a cloud based server also comes along with number of benefits and some dark side.  In cloud technology, no need for onsite hardware which is very suited to fast growing companies that may outgrow their infrastructure soon and extra resources and be accessed as when required. The scalability of cloud is probably the strongest differentiation between the cloud and the local server. All the cloud users can connect from anywhere using any devices. Where the best deal is data can be backed up in the cloud as regularly as 15 minute intervals which minimize the data loss in disaster unlike the on-premise server. 

On the dark side, user needs to be totally depending on the speed of the internet connection. In the event that the Internet goes down on your side or on your cloud provider side, you won't have access to any of your data. Coming together, there is always a risk of privacy or security as third party can have a direct access to our data on which many security researchers are working.

Seeing this huge comfort in cloud technology, around 52% of organizations were already using the cloud services for better performance, backup and disaster recovery, where remaining 48% are still in traditional technology, a very few percentage started exploring the cloud.
