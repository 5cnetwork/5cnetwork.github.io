This article has been the hardest to write for me by far. The challenge is to try to sum up a month of experiences is just a few paragraphs. This post even marks the end of my internship here with 5C Network. In the past few days, I have been thinking about how to start this and finally, here we go.

I thoroughly enjoyed my internship this summer and now have very valuable experience under my belt. My internship at Experience has taught me something totally different from what I have learned in my class room. Which I am really proud of. I feel my duties were diverse and very essential. Sometimes it’s tough to recall everything I have taken in over the past months, but the most interesting part I found was my interview.

One fine day I got a call from my boss around 2:30 pm and said: “Hello Losel, can you be here in the office at 3 for the interview?”. Nervously I said yes. Thought an old guy with gray hair will come and take my breath away during the interview but it didn’t happen. When the interview started, I felt as if I am attending Google interview, sitting inside a glass house, waiting for the interviewer and finally CEO of 5C Network came to take my interview. It went till 5:30 with lots of questions and finally I’m outside the office, waiting for the confirmation email. Finally, after one day I got my email.

I think that an internship is extremely valuable to a student. It is a small taste of the real world. It helped reinforce my knowledge of responsibility, focus, drive, and ambition. I had to be responsible for getting to work on time, fulfilling my word and completing all of the tasks that I was assigned which I was not perfect but I tried. I learned to focus. I learned to drive during really long days of events. I got tired but didn’t give up. The only way to gain experience, and move up in the working world is to be driven, focused and to have a will to never give up. I was gaining experience and lessons which are more valuable to my future career success than any amount of money or credit hours. I was only able to gain this experience because of the requirement to complete a semester internship. It was an invaluable tool to help me figure out to work with the time constraint. 

Working with an IT company who contributes on health domain is totally a different thing. You have to understand completely different terminology to carry out your work. Open communication was one of the strongest and most apparent skills that I learned during my internship. When I first started interning, I was intimidated and nervous to ask too many questions because I didn’t want to admit that I didn’t understand or that I needed extra help with something. Luckily I got over that fear quickly because asking questions is the only way to learn what you are really supposed to be doing. 

This experience finally opened my eyes to the real world. I will be the first to admit that I am not the most responsible person, but I have come to realize that responsibility sets a good employee apart from an excellent employee. I am in this internship because of my lack of willingness to get up and get an internship earlier in the college year, but everything happens for a reason. And I am happy that I learned a lot. 

I think the internship is a great opportunity for college students to get ready for the real world and grow up. You will enjoy but at the same time, you will cry sometimes. I think if I answered this question before my internship, I would ask, why do we have to do internships at all,  aren't college classes enough? But now I know, college classes aren't enough, I got the first-hand experience in the "real world". Got my feet wet a little bit before I graduate college.
