We all are familiar with a saying that “health is wealth”. Being in a good health itself is a best resource to become wealthy. 

Healthcare is one of the largest service sectors in India as it should be by taking the population of India into consideration where both public sector and private sector plays a very active role. Government hospital provides medical facilities at very low cost to everyone where as private hospital charges higher than the government.  

With the rapid growth of population and shortage of medical facilities provided by government, many private health care services came into scene. But according to World Bank, nearly 27crore people come under poverty line in India. So, definitely these people will prefer government hospitals.

**Problem faced by government hospitals:**

Since the major population prefer government hospital, it automatically creates a huge queue outside every department and imbalance ratio between doctors and patients rises. Since the pressure on doctors are lesser in private sector and higher pay scale makes then move to private sector. At last the problems knock at government hospitals door due to the lack of quantity of staffs and doctors, especially in the emergency situation when immediate supports of doctors are needed. 

Even after having imaging technology, if the diagnoses are not done by radiologist. A proper medical decision cannot be made for better medical treatment by the clinician. We are facing large shortage of radiologist especially in government hospitals. Satisfaction level of the patient was not found to be totally satisfied with respect to the treatment and report generation. 

**Need for Solution: Tele-radiology**

**Tele-radiology:** Tele-radiology is the transmission of radiological patient images, for example, x-ray, CTs, and MRIs, from with one distinct location to the next for the reasons for imparting studies to different radiologists and doctors.

Tele-radiology took birth somewhat because of the unevenness between the request and availability of radiologist. The ultimate solution which we can provide to those hospitals, patients, diagnosis centres, radiologist and clinician is only through Tele-radiology. 

5C Network is such a solution providing technologist whose services are currently spread across 12 districts hospital in Karnataka, 40+ hospitals and diagnosis centres in 6 other states and 35 fully dedicated active radiologists are connected. Their service helped many private and government hospitals with count more than 10,000 scans till now during peak emergencies. 

5C or 5Clique is collaborated with government of Karnataka and many other organisations to bring a better outcome in healthcare; they helped to set up facility like eKirana to connect government hospitals across Karnataka to the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) to enable immediate reading of scanned images, they also connected hospitals of major districts in Karnataka to the central hub as a part of  

**TELE-RADIOLOGY HAS POTENTIAL AS A BUSINESS MODEL AND ALSO FOR HEALTHY INDIA.**
