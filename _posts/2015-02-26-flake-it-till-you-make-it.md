**_It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity._**

                                                             - Albert Einstein

Radiology is a specialized branch of medicine using medical imaging technologies to diagnose and treat patients. The role of the radiologist involvement has increased drastically in the clinical management of patients with the development of medical image technology such as X-Ray, CT scan, MRI, PET scan and etc.

**Some Statistics:** 

 A country with a billion population and around 8000 radiologist leads to a huge disproportion effecting millions of lives. Now according to the Indian Journal of Radiology and imaging, “_In the next decade, radiology will have a very limited role to play. USG facilities will double and CT scan and MRI will continue to grow in an exponential way, with more and more indications being included. Molecular imaging will become available in all the big metros. India will need about 20,000 radiologists if the benefits of imaging are to reach every corner of the country._”
 
“_growth rates of CT and MRI in Sweden have continuously exceeded growth rates of practicing radiologists_”, according to a new report from telemedicine firm TMC.

“_France, which performs more CT exams than any other country in Europe, faces a double threat regarding its radiologist population_”

**Challenges Faced by people:**

The current major challenge face by the hospitals or diagnosis centres is the limited number of radiologist in order to provide a better medical decision for patient. A proper medical decision is needed to plan and evaluates a patient’s treatment in time. 

The challenge for scholastic radiology in India is thusly going to be the issue of teaching and preparing an adequate number of inhabitants which takes years of practice. Considering this huge gap between the diagnosis centre, clinician and radiologist the concept of making a bridge among them came in scenario.

**What 5C Network does?** 

5C Network provides a platform by connecting hospitals or diagnosis centres with the radiologists through their portal providing multiple services from viewing scanned images with different tools to examine the image to the report creating for the patient and the reference for the clinician. Every hospital's and diagnostic centre's private radiologist. An efficient and cost effective way to approach a medical problem.

The feature of providing medical report is a key factor for the clinician and patient as it might involves both medical and legal aspects i.e., Medicolegal cases which can lead to a police case. 

The process of 5C network begins when a doctor recommend patient to do a diagnosis which are facilitate by some hospitals or private diagnostic centres where technician will operate the tools. On the one side where technician and clinician need service from the radiologist to have broader view on diagnosing the patient, this platform connects it to the desired radiologist keeping the time constraint providing online radiologist support and every radiologist is empowered to reach out to these hospitals and provide their expertise. 

5C Network facilities are available today in 40+ hospitals and radiologist in the Karnataka and further looking for more hospitals and radiologist to come under their umbrella.
